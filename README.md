# Assignment 1

Before moving forward make sure you follow through this free Git [course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) on Code School. In addition, you should keep nearby to you Git's official [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

The goal of this assignment is for you to get familiarized with a formal development pipeline. You are expected to perform some simple tasks that will become a common part of your workflow moving forward.

## Tasks
* [ ] Clone this git repo locally create an empty directory and add a .keep file within it. Push your changes to the remote repository.
* [ ] Add a `MathUtilities` class.
  * [ ] Get the nearest int to a float.
  * [ ] Round a float to the nearest even integer value.
  * [ ] Get the maximum of any two, three, or four floats (as well as ints). Use of templates will result in extra credits
  * [ ] Get the minimum of any two, three, or four floats (as well as ints). Use of templates will result in extra credits
  * [ ] Clamp a float (or an int) to be within a specified range
  * [ ] Convert an angle in degrees to radians, and vice-versa
  * [ ] Calculate the angular distance from angle A to angle B (in both degrees and radians)
  * [ ] Determine if an int is a "power of two"
  * [ ] Interpolate a float (or an int) between a start value and an end value, at a fraction specified from start (0.0) to end (1.0).
* [ ] Create a class, call it `Color`. Add the necessary properties to manage colors with it, taking into account that we will be using a four channel representation in the RGBA form.
* [ ] Create a static class, call it `Colors`, that uses the previous `Color` class to represent 5 colors of your choice. Each color should have a name, and you should be able to change the screen background back using each color structure. Be creative with the class definition and its implementation.

## Notes
* You are free to follow the design techniques you see fit. Those who take into account ease of use, read and maintain will earn extra credit.
* Proper naming of variables, classes and functions will result in extra credit.
* The Boiler Plate project is referenced as a Git submodule, read more about how to retrieve the code by reading the [official](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) documentation.
